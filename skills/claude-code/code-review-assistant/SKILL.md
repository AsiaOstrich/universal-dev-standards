3. **Quality** - Clean code?
4. **Readability** - Easy to understand?
5. **Tests** - Adequate coverage?
6. **Security** - No vulnerabilities?

### Pre-Commit Checklist

- [ ] Build succeeds (zero errors, zero warnings)
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code follows project standards
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Branch synced with target

## Detailed Guidelines

For complete standards, see:
- [Review Checklist](./review-checklist.md)
- [Pre-Commit Checklist](./checkin-checklist.md)

## Example Review Comments

```markdown
❗ BLOCKING: Potential SQL injection vulnerability here.
Please use parameterized queries instead of string concatenation.

⚠️ IMPORTANT: This method is doing too much (120 lines).
Consider extracting validation logic to a separate method.

💡 SUGGESTION: Consider using a Map here instead of an array for O(1) lookup.

❓ QUESTION: Why are we using setTimeout here instead of async/await?

📝 NOTE: This is a clever solution! Nice use of reduce here.
```

## Core Principles

1. **Be Respectful** - Review code, not the person
2. **Be Thorough** - Check functionality, not just syntax
3. **Be Timely** - Review within 24 hours
4. **Be Clear** - Explain WHY, not just WHAT
