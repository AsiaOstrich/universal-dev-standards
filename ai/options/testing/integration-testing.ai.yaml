  description: Testing interactions between components

characteristics:
  scope: Multiple components working together
  speed: "<1 second per test"
  isolation: Partial (may use real dependencies)
  pyramid_percentage: 20%

rules:
  - id: test-integration-points
    trigger: writing integration test
    instruction: Focus on boundaries between components
    priority: required

  - id: use-real-dependencies
    trigger: setting up integration test
    instruction: Use real implementations when possible, test doubles for external services
    priority: recommended

  - id: test-data-management
    trigger: setting up test data
    instruction: Use fixtures or factories, clean up after tests
    priority: required

  - id: database-isolation
    trigger: testing with database
    instruction: Use test database, rollback or truncate between tests
    priority: required

when_to_write:
  - Testing API endpoints
  - Testing database operations
  - Testing service interactions
  - Testing message queues
  - Testing cache behavior

integration_points:
  - name: Database
    approach: Use test database with Testcontainers or in-memory DB
    example: |
      const db = await TestcontainersDb.start();
      const repo = new UserRepository(db);
      await repo.save(user);
      const found = await repo.findById(user.id);
      expect(found).toEqual(user);

  - name: HTTP API
    approach: Use real HTTP client, mock external services
    example: |
      const response = await request(app)
        .post('/api/users')
        .send({ name: 'Test User' });
      expect(response.status).toBe(201);

  - name: Message Queue
    approach: Use embedded queue or Testcontainers
    example: |
      await publisher.send('user.created', event);
      const received = await consumer.receive();
      expect(received.payload).toEqual(event);

tools:
  database:
    - Testcontainers
    - Docker Compose
    - In-memory databases (H2, SQLite)
  http:
    - Supertest (Node.js)
    - RestAssured (Java)
    - requests (Python)
  mocking:
    - WireMock
    - MockServer
    - nock (Node.js)
