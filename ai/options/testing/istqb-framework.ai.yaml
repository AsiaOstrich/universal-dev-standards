  description: ISTQB standard testing framework with 4 levels
  source: "ISTQB Glossary v4.0 (https://glossary.istqb.org)"

best_for:
  - Enterprise projects requiring formal QA processes
  - Projects needing certification or compliance
  - Organizations with dedicated QA teams
  - Waterfall or hybrid development methodologies
  - Projects with strict audit requirements

levels:
  - name: Unit Testing (UT)
    abbreviation: UT
    istqb_term: "Component Testing"
    definition: Testing individual software components in isolation
    purpose: Verify code units work correctly
    performed_by: Developers

  - name: Integration Testing (IT/SIT)
    abbreviation: IT or SIT
    istqb_term: "Integration Testing"
    definition: Testing interfaces and interactions between integrated components
    purpose: Verify component interactions
    performed_by: Developers or QA
    note: |
      - IT (Integration Testing): Common in Agile/DevOps
      - SIT (System Integration Testing): Common in Enterprise/ISTQB contexts
      Both terms refer to the same testing level

  - name: System Testing (ST)
    abbreviation: ST
    istqb_term: "System Testing"
    definition: Testing the complete integrated system to verify it meets requirements
    purpose: Verify system meets functional and non-functional requirements
    performed_by: QA Team

  - name: Acceptance Testing (AT/UAT)
    abbreviation: AT or UAT
    istqb_term: "Acceptance Testing"
    definition: Testing to determine if the system satisfies business needs
    purpose: Verify system meets business requirements
    performed_by: End users or business stakeholders
    subtypes:
      - name: User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
        description: Validation by actual users
      - name: Contract Acceptance Testing
        description: Verification against contract criteria
      - name: Regulatory Acceptance Testing
        description: Compliance verification

test_types:
  functional:
    - Functional testing
    - User interface testing
    - Regression testing
  non_functional:
    - Performance testing
    - Security testing
    - Usability testing
    - Reliability testing

rules:
  - id: four-level-structure
    trigger: planning test strategy with ISTQB
    instruction: |
      Use 4 levels: UT → IT/SIT → ST → AT/UAT
      Each level has specific entry/exit criteria
    priority: required

  - id: requirement-traceability
    trigger: creating test cases
    instruction: Each test case should trace to a requirement
    priority: required

  - id: defect-classification
    trigger: reporting defects
    instruction: Classify defects by severity and priority per ISTQB guidelines
    priority: recommended

comparison_with_industry:
  columns: [ISTQB Level, Industry Equivalent, Key Difference]
  rows:
    - [Unit Testing, Unit Testing (UT), Same concept]
    - [Integration Testing, Integration Testing (IT/SIT), Same concept, different abbreviation conventions]
    - [System Testing, Often merged with E2E, ISTQB separates system validation from user acceptance]
    - [Acceptance Testing, Part of E2E, ISTQB has dedicated level for business validation]

when_to_choose:
  choose_istqb_when:
    - Need formal test documentation
    - Working with QA certification bodies
    - Enterprise environment with compliance requirements
    - Team includes certified ISTQB professionals
    - Audit trail is important
  avoid_istqb_when:
    - Rapid iteration is priority
    - Small team without dedicated QA
    - Pure DevOps/Continuous Delivery focus
    - Documentation overhead is concern
