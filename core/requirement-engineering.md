## Summary

Requirements Engineering is the systematic process of eliciting, analyzing, specifying, and validating software requirements throughout the development lifecycle. It provides the theoretical foundation for writing, managing, and validating requirements based on industry standards including IEEE 830-1998, IEEE 29148-2018, SWEBOK v4.0, and ISO/IEC 25010.

The process encompasses Functional Requirements (what the system should DO), Non-Functional Requirements (quality attributes like performance, security, usability), and Constraints. User Stories (Agile format) with Acceptance Criteria (Given-When-Then) serve as the primary specification format, validated through INVEST criteria (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable).
